## NPM Dependencies

Currently the external dependencies are managed by npm, they are installed during the building of the Dockerfile by running the following command

```
npm ci --only=production
```

and then moving the installed libraries to the public_html/ folder.

## TODO
### Add some kind of offline version of https://bitbucket.org/magnusmanske/tooltranslate.git

This could potentially be some kind of homebrew thing that looks at the toolinfo.json and pulls the all the translations when the Dockerfile builds and puts these in the `public_html/` folder

```
https://tools-static.wmflabs.org/tooltranslate/data/quickstatements/toolinfo.json
```

This would also require a rewrite of https://tools-static.wmflabs.org/tooltranslate/tt.js
